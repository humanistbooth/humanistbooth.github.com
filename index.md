This is an informal list of some online resources folks at the
Humanist Outreach booth (at Balboa Park in San Diego most Saturdays)
reocommend; similar to our recommended book list.
These are not Secular Humanist per se, but are related.</p>

<b>Pharangula - Blog </br></b>
By Humanist and Biologist PZ Myers.</br>
<a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula">https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula</a></br>
"PZ Myers is a biologist at the University of Minnesota Morris, with
a special interest in developmental biology and evolution. He’s been
battling creationists and bible-wallopers on the internet since 1993,
and has gotten slightly curmudgeonly about it all. The blog Pharyngula
is his outlet for venting his fury at faith, stupidity, and injustice,
an occupation which somehow led to him being named American Humanist
of the Year in 2009, and International Humanist of 2011 by the
IHEU. He’s confident that science is the only tool we have for
reaching new knowledge, regards faith and ignorance as vices, and
finds happiness with his family."</p>

<b>Gutsick Gibbon - Youtube</br></b>

"Welcome to Gutsick Gibbon! I'm Erika, a current PhD student in
Biological Anthropology. I have a Masters of Research degree in
Primate Biology, Behavior and Conservation with a BSA in
Pre-Professional Animal Science and minors in Anthropology and in
Biology.</br>
  Here you can find videos concerning primates, general zoology,
paleontology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology! I also spend a
hefty amount of time debunking Young Earth Creationism, which I find
to be an enjoyable hobby akin to debunking Flat Earth.</br>
  I find there to be a deep and personal beauty in being a part of the
animal kingdom, and thus strive to be a gentle and modern ape. I hope
you leave here feeling the same way!"</p>

<a href="https://ffrf.org">
https://ffrf.org</a></br>
"The history of Western civilization shows us that most social and
moral progress has been brought about by persons free from
religion. In modern times the first to speak out for prison reform,
for humane treatment of the mentally ill, for abolition of capital
punishment, for women's right to vote, for death with dignity for the
terminally ill, and for the right to choose contraception,
sterilization and abortion have been freethinkers, just as they were
the first to call for an end to slavery. The Foundation works as an
umbrella for those who are free from religion and are committed to the
cherished principle of separation of state and church."</br>
Online resources include a 10-times-a-year magazine, FreeThought Today (also
available in paper form),
frequent news releases, videos, a blog, and a podcast/radio program.  There
are also brocures and books, and local chapters.

entanglements on behalf of its members and the public."

"I initiate friendly conversations with people to see how they arrived
at their deeply-held beliefs (e.g., Gods, karma, ghosts, politics,
etc.), and then ask respectful questions to help them discover if the
method(s) used are unreliable so that more reliable methods can be
employed to maintain the belief and/or the level of confidence in the
belief can be adjusted to be more in line with reality."</p>

Recommended by one of our group members (Wayne) although some people believe
that the principal (Dr. Michael Greger, the president of Nutritionfacts
Org Inc), tends to overstate the case for what he recommends: a diet centered
on whole plant food.
