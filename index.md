[https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula](https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula)  
"PZ Myers is a biologist at the University of Minnesota Morris, with a special interest in developmental biology and evolution. He’s been battling creationists and bible-wallopers on the internet since 1993, and has gotten slightly curmudgeonly about it all. The blog Pharyngula is his outlet for venting his fury at faith, stupidity, and injustice, an occupation which somehow led to him being named American Humanist of the Year in 2009, and International Humanist of 2011 by the IHEU. He’s confident that science is the only tool we have for reaching new knowledge, regards faith and ignorance as vices, and finds happiness with his family."

Here you can find videos concerning primates, general zoology, paleontology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology! I also spend a hefty amount of time debunking Young Earth Creationism, which I find to be an enjoyable hobby akin to debunking Flat Earth.

The Foundation works as an umbrella for those who are free from religion and are committed to the cherished principle of separation of state and church."  
Online resources include a 10-times-a-year magazine, FreeThought Today (also available in paper form), frequent news releases, videos, a blog, and a podcast/radio program.
