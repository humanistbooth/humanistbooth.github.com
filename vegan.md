**Vegan/Vegetarian Online Recommendations**

This is an informal list of some recommended online resources related to plant-based whole foods and Vegan choices, that some of us participating at the Humanist Outreach booth (at Balboa Park in San Diego most Saturdays) find useful; similar to our recommended book list and our more general online recommendations list. Our main motivations for this are to:
1. reduce animal suffering,
2. reduce our impact on the environment and/or
3. improve our own health and well-being.

**To reduce animal suffering:**

"A 2018 study found that global adoption of plant-based diets would reduce agricultural land use by 76% (3.1 billion hectares, an area the size of Africa) and cut total global greenhouse gas emissions by 28%. Half of this emissions reduction came from avoided emissions from animal production including methane and nitrous oxide, and half came from trees re-growing on abandoned farmland which remove carbon dioxide from the air.\[302\]\[290\] The authors conclude that avoiding meat and diary is the 'single biggest way' to reduce one's impact on Earth.\[21\]"

**For our health:**  

**NutritionFacts.org - Videos and Podcasts**  
Promoting evidence-based diets for longer, healthier lives  
[https://www.NutritionFacts.org](https://www.NutritionFacts.org)  
"What is the healthiest diet? Find out what the latest science is saying about your favorite foods to help you make the healthiest choices for you and your family. Watch our free videos on more than 2,000 health and nutrition topics with new videos and articles uploaded every day."  

Recommended by one of our group members (Wayne) although some people believe that the principal (Dr. Michael Greger, the president of Nutritionfacts Org Inc), tends to overstate the case for what he recommends: a diet centered on whole plant food.

It's good and reasonable to be skeptical of diet plans, as many are pseudo-science nonsense, pushed by people making money from them. And the whole field of nutrition and diet is full of conflicting information too.

But the NutritionsFacts web site and diet plan was recommended by Wayne's doctor and his health care system (Kaiser-Permanente), he found the NutritionFacts articles persuasive (seemed well founded on peer-reviewed science, and well reasoned), and so tried it (to a large extent), liked it, and lost a bit of weight and found it improved his cholesterol numbers nicely (enough that his doctor decided statins were not needed). There seems to be solid evidence that lowering cholesterol and increasing our fiber intake improves our odds of avoiding some of the major killers in the U.S. today: heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.

This doesn't have to be all or nothing; just eating less meat, dairy, eggs, fish, sugar, salt, and processed food, and more unprocessed fruit, vegetables and whole grains can help a lot. Exercise is useful too. You should also take a B-12 supplement and have a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, such as ground flax seeds, as part of your diet.

The food industry contributes to confusion in the field as described in the 8 part series on NutritionFacts starting with [https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-big-sugar-undermines-dietary-guidelines/](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-big-sugar-undermines-dietary-guidelines)
