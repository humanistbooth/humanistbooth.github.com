**Ask An Atheist<br>Questions and Answers<br>by Wayne**

I'm a frequent volunteer/participant at the [Secular Outreach booth](https://www.facebook.com/askanatheistbooth/) in Balboa Park (also see our [Online Resources page](https://humanistbooth.github.io/)).  The purpose of our booth is to counter-balance the religious booths there (various Christian Fundamentalists especially), let people know that we exist too (being 'out' Atheists) representing our community in a positive way, let fellow seculars know about groups in the San Diego area, and engage with friendly discussion and debate with religious folks.  One of our banners is inviting people to "Ask An Atheist". This is a lot of fun, both in talking with people who stop by (and/or listening to others' discussions), and chatting with fellow Agnostic-Atheists in the booth (interesting stories from former Mainline or Fundamentalist Protestants, Catholics, Mormons/LDS, Jehovah's Witness, Muslim and Hindu, and life-long Atheists).

Chatting with religious folks who stop by, we don't often change people's minds but we try to help them understand our point of view, encourage them to apply reason and consider evidence, and we sometimes influence others who listen in on some of our discussions.  I know that for me, growing up, it seemed like everyone was religious, and it was refreshing to eventually learn that there were some who were non-religious (as I was growing towards those views).  If I had grown up in a village some centuries ago, where everyone believed the local church doctrine, I probably would have remained convinced that believing anything else was unreasonable.

In this write-up I'm trying to list some common and interesting questions and how I'd reply in written form.  A live discussion is better in ways, but it's always difficult to describe my beliefs accurately, quickly, and briefly.  In this, I'm trying to be accurate and clear, and still keep it fairly brief.  In this form, I can also include some web links.  I'm thinking I can refer people to this for after our chats, and people who I don't talk with can find it of interest too.

The best discussions are when visitors are honestly interested in what we believe and why.  And, of course, as part of that I like to hear what they believe and why too, and we go back and forth and compare and contrast.

When I talk about my 'beliefs' I don't mean a cherished beliefs like religious ones, but just what I consider to be most likely true.  I've changed some of my beliefs over time, and I think that's largely based on evidence, logic, and reason, and science.  (My church life growing up was, for the most part, a positive experience (although sometimes boring).)

This is called 'critical thinking' and I highly recommend studying up on that, especially in today's society with so much misinformation, pseudoscience, and conspiracy theories around.  But I recognize that we all, including myself, have trouble doing it well; we're subject to lots of unconscious biases, logical fallacies, and such.  A good source for this is [The Skeptics Guide to the Universe](https://legacy.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu) : "dedicated to promoting critical thinking, reason, and the public understanding of science through online and other media."

Science, in my opinion, is the best method we have to separate likely truth from non-truth.  You only have to look at the technology and science-based medicine we now have, to see how well it works.

Science has limitations tho, too, and can be skewed by big money, as we've seen by the tobacco, fossil fuel, and processed food industries (sometimes just seeking to seed doubt).  This isn't a big conspiracy, it's just corporations doing what they do, trying to maximize profits.

Here are some of the better common questions we often get (they are said to us in various ways, but I'll use a concise version).

### Q: Why don't you believe in God?  [1 of 6]

There are lots of reasons, but I like to start with the existence of many different religions.

I grew up religious, in a Mainline Protestant church*, but as I learned of other religions I wondered how do I actually know that mine is true, and others false.  If I had been born in India, for example, I'd likely be a Hindu.  And people of other religions feel the presence of their god as much as, and are as devout as, people in my church.  Yet the religions are very much different in what their god or gods are like and what you need to do to be saved.  Even across the many Christian Protestant denominations there are differences in some basic ethics, like whether abortion is wrong or sometimes OK, whether LGBTQ+ individuals should be considered sinners or their rights supported, if they're environmentalist or anti-green.  And many of them claim we have to be part of their particular denomination to be saved.

* My family's church was part of the Evangelical United Brethren (E.U.B.) denomination which merged in 1966 with the Methodists to form the United Methodist denomination.

Richard Dawkins, in his book The God Delusion, put it well: "We are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further."

At the same time, there's good evidence that people believe what they do mainly based on personal relationship with loved ones and people they respect.  It's really after we unconsciously decide to be part of a particular church, that we find reasons for the beliefs.

And, as Jonathan Swift (a 17th century author, poet, and cleric) put it: "You cannot reason someone out of something they were not reasoned into".  But, still, I like to try.

I have many other reasons for not believing in the Christian God: implausible bible stories, logical inconsistencies, and the more likely idea that religions 'evolve' and do that based on survival value (how well they appeal to people), not Truth.  These are outlined in later sections.

For additional responses, see "Why else don't you believe in God?" items [2-6 of 6], below.

### Q: So, as an Atheist, you're asserting there is no God, right?

I call myself an Atheist because if you ask me the question, do you believe in God, I answer 'no'.  So that's different than asserting that there is no God and that I'm sure of it.  But that is atheism, using the root 'theist', i.e., holding religious beliefs, so atheist, with the 'a' (not) prefix, is without religious beliefs.

I'm also an Agnostic.  In typical usage, agnostic is thought of as being a sort-of atheist, but a better definition is based on the root 'gnostic' being knowledge, so agnostic is without knowledge.  In simple terms, "I'm not sure".  But I don't think we can be absolutely sure much of anything.

So more accurately, I call myself an Agnostic Atheist.

### Q: So you're not sure?

For religious beliefs, ideas on the ultimate nature of reality, meaning of life, etc, people obviously come to different conclusions, even reasonable, smart, and well-informed people.  I think it's clear there cannot be any certainty.  I just assign a very low probability to any gods existing, and especially any particular god.

There many things I think are very, very, likely to be true, and these are basis for various reasonable decisions but, at a fundamental level, there's really very little that I'm really 100% certain of.  I can tell I exist because I am thinking and appear to be sensing things; but much else could be hallucinations (although with in a coherent and coordinated form).  See the last two paragraphs for aspects of this.

We all have difficulty figuring out what is likely to be true.  All of us have memories that are often very inaccurate, have unconscious biases, are prone to logical fallacies and have difficulty finding reliable sources of information.  I try to apply 'critical thinking' techniques which I think helps (more on that in another question below). As does keeping an open mind and discussing ideas with
people with beliefs that are different than ours.

(As an interesting side-note, this sense of self is actually itself constructed in our brains and can disappear in some mental illnesses or the use of some psychedelic drugs.  Their sense of being an individual, distinct from the rest of the world becomes diminished or altogether dissolved.)

(Another interesting side-note is that as a youth, I considered something along the lines of Solipsism, even before I learned that it existed as a philosophy.  It's interesting to consider, but doesn't really go anywhere, and seems, to me, to be very very unlikely itself. Solipsism is the philosophical idea that only one's mind is sure to exist and that the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind.  Sort of like The Matrix. See [wikipedia Solipsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism) ).


### Q: If there is no God, where did we come from?

We evolved here.  If you don't accept evolution as true, that's a whole long discussion itself, but there is actually overwhelming evidence for it.

Some people ask if we believe in 'Darwinism', but that's a wrong way to phrase it.  Darwin (and others) made great advances in our understanding of evolution, but we don't revere him as a prophet like religious people revere church leaders.  It's not revealed Truth to Darwin, just that he was able to make good progress.

The theory of evolution has evolved over time.

A major part of why science works so well, is that there are incentives for disproving the ideas that are currently held, i.e., providing solid evidence for changes.  That encourages the hypotheses and theories to change over time, to become better aligned with reality, being modified and refined, and occasionally replaced.

Plate Tectonics is a good example,  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics#History_of_the_theory)

### Q: But the genome contains information, right?

Yes, genomes contain information, especially sequences that code for various proteins.  I heard a podcast with a Nobel laureate, Frances Arnold, if I'm remembering correctly, and she described the genome as containing 'information'.

### Q: But randomness can't create information, so it must be from God.

But natural selection is not random.  I agree that random events do not create information, and that random mutations are part of how evolution works, but the driving force of evolution is natural selection, and that is not random, it selects for attributes that work better.  Most mutations do nothing, quite a few are harmful, and occasionally some are beneficial.  If those beneficial changes help the organism survive, it's more likely to live and reproduce and pass on those changes to the next generation.  Over lots of time, this produces significant changes.

Once you understand evolution some, it's really awesome.

But if you don't understand evolution, you're not alone as it is often not taught properly.  A Penn State study found that only 28% of High School teachers teach evolution consistent with national research council recommendations.  And 13% actually actively endorse creationism.  The rest, about 60%, are 'cautious', presenting evolution without endorsing it.

Here's an Atheist Experience video on this: [Why Do Creationists Attack Evolution?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONPo-Iys_xg)

And here's an article about the study: [sciencedaily.com](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110127141657.htm)

What I described is actually a simplified view of evolution too, as I'm not an expert.  In addition to natural selection there's the neutral theory of molecular evolution or neutral genetic drift. See this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution)

Also see this [Pharyngula post](https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/02/08/it-takes-multiple-mechanisms-to-drive-evolution/).

### Q: So we see micro-evolution, but never major changes, why would that be?

Bigger changes take longer.  We see bigger steps in fossil records. And these correlate well with genetic comparisons.

### Q: But there are gaps in the fossil records.

Every time we find a fossil that fills a gap, two more smaller gaps are created.

Fossil records are always incomplete.  Fossilization requires certain conditions so many bones and shells do not fossilize.  And, of those, only a small fraction of fossils become exposed and accessible.  And only a small fraction of those are found and analyzed.

[We have a hand-out on Evolution that I wrote a while ago; I'll try to include a link to an online version here sometime]

### Q: But where did life come from?

We don't currently have a complete, definite, picture, but in recent decades scientists have made some gains in understanding some likely, natural, mechanisms.

There are five nucleobases, the bases letters in the genetic code: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U), and we've found all five of those on meteors in space; they self assemble, they don't need special conditions, or magic, to do that, and they chain together by themselves.

In recent decades we've discovered that all the basic building blocks of life self assemble, under remarkably mundane conditions.

It's like we have steps 1, 2, 3, and 5 thru 100 figured out, and are missing step 4.  Some of these steps became clear in the last few decades.

Forrest Valkai, on this [Atheist Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqrT0iZSq3A) video called "Intelligent Design Supporters Treated Unfairly?" covers it well. 

Starting with just six everyday chemicals, such as water and methane, scientists were able to determine that tens of thousands of substances found in living organisms, can be formed. (see [science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw1955) ). So the young Earth was a factory for biological chemicals.

One idea is that hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the seas were the likely cradles of life; with various types of magna-driven chemistry possibly involved, using these biological chemicals.

Another is that land pools near active volcanoes, that repeatedly dried and got wet again, could have been the cradle of life.

[Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-did-life-begin-on-earth/) "How did life begin on Earth".

I don't believe it's appropriate to just defer to authority on important ideas, but I do respect the expertise of scientists (and the fact that they are rewarded for changing minds) and the vast majority of scientists in the field have no problem seeing how various natural processes can lead to the origin of life.

### Q: So where did the Universe come from?

This is a big topic too, but I'll outline a bit.

Basically, we don't know, but that doesn't necessarily imply that a god must therefore exist to create it.  Something natural from a previous universe may have triggered the Big Bang, assuming the Big Bang is real (see below), or in some other way the universe may have always existed.  Or there may be many universes that somehow spawn others.

But even if we believe a god created the universe, we wouldn't know anything about that god, which one it was/is, or even if it still exists.  It could be that the god died as it created the universe.

This argument, that we don't know 'x' so it must be God, is known as the "God of the Gaps" argument, where Christians point to the things that science has not explained and fill those gaps with God.  In the past, there were many gaps, and many of those are now filled with well understood natural processes.  There are still deep mysteries, like Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Quantum Physics (Quantum Mechanics). Quantum Physics is really weird, but describes particle actions very well, but some scientists believe there must be a deeper theory to explain what is seen.

But even then, we don't really know why particles behave as they do, or why gravity bends space-time; but over and over again we've found that what use to be thought be magic or gods' or God's actions, have turned out to be natural processes.

Some argue that Big Bang cosmology implies a creator, while others argue that it makes the notion of a creator superfluous.  Those supporting the latter view include Stephen Hawking, in his book "A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes" (which I read years ago).

As I understand it, in Big Bang cosmology, not only did matter and energy burst forth, but also space and time itself.  If you ponder that a bit, it's really awesome, and really difficult to wrap your head around.  There is no before the Big Bang because time itself started in the bang.  And the universe didn't explode into space, but space itself was (and is still) expanding, in all directions, at all places.  So time really only has meaning within the universe, and outside of it, and before it, aren't real, because that's when time began.  Since we live in the universe, we experience time and cause and effect constantly, but it may be limited to the universe.

We should keep in mind too, that while Big Bang cosmology is supported by much evidence, there are some problems with it.  Notably (even for us lay people), are Dark Energy (i.e., something causing the Universe to continue to accelerate it's expansion) and Dark Matter (gravity that visible matter doesn't explain).

I highly recommend at least a cursory look at the Big Bang article on Wikipedia (not the Big Bang Theory TV series :-) ).  Also note there the pie chart illustrating that Dark Matter and Dark Energy comprise the vast majority of the universe, more than 96%.

And even with the accelerating expansion of the universe, cosmologists believe that some sort of periodic expansion, dissolution, and re-expansion is quite feasible.  I.e., maybe the universe (or universes) always existed in a series of expanding universes.

### Q: Where do you get your morals?

At a fundamental level, we have morals and ethics because we are a highly social species; we empathize with others (if we have good mental health), depend on others and help each other.

At a practical level, we learn our ethics from culture and upbringing. We learn starting at an early age.  For example, we throw sand at our playmate in a sandbox, and our care-giver tells us not to do that.

Our culture in modern times includes TV shows, comic books (super heroes), movies, music, books, magazines with stories that include moral dilemmas and resolutions, and more recently online social media. It's not like media companies are indoctrinating us, but that stories that resonate with larger numbers of people become more popular, creating a feedback loop.  In recent decades media proliferation has lead to fragmentation into two or more groups, left and right, and more.

But we also reason about ethics too.  It makes sense for me to treat you well as it's likely you will treat me well back, and treat others well, creating a more supporting society.

As Atheists, we simply answer 'no' to 'do you believe in God', so our ethical systems vary.  But our booth is also Secular Humanist which does affirm additional principles.

We consider scientific evidence too.  For example, although we don't know the details, there's evidence that homosexuality, like many other human traits, is formed by a combination of genes and environment, and is not really a choice.  This applies to trans people too.  So it makes sense to treat people of all orientations with respect.  So I support LGBTQ+ rights.  In my view, this is an improvement over conservative religious views (e.g., the Christian Right).

Similarly, in my opinion, there is clear evidence that there is now, and has been for centuries, structural inequality in our society based on gender, race, class, disability, and ethnicity.  And that all of these inequalities are unjustified and causes great harm.  So I believe that working toward equity is the right thing to do, and that ethical values like these are an improvement over the conservative side of many religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and others).

If your religion includes the belief that the greatest good is to love one another, then that's something we agree on.  That's a solid foundation for morals and ethics.  And by 'one another' we mean all people, not just my 'tribe', however we might define that.

### Q: My religious beliefs keep me from harming others, do you want to take that away from me?

No, I'm fine with you believing in your religion if it really is helping you to avoid harming others.  I think you deserve a lot of the credit yourself, as deep down you probably do understand the need to treat others with kindness and respect.

### Q: My church helped me recover from addiction, don't you value that?

I do value that and I think it's great that you are fighting your addiction, and if your church helps you with that, that's wonderful. I think you should be given a lot of the credit tho and there are other groups that can help and are quite effective.

We recommend "SMART Recovery" (Self-Management and Recovery Training) which is is an international non-profit organization that provides assistance to individuals seeking abstinence from addiction. The SMART approach is secular and research-based, using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and non-confrontational motivational methods. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_Recovery) SMART Recovery article.

### Q: But your morals are just relative (where mine are absolute as they are based on a solid foundation, the bible).

Your moral basis is relative too.  If you tell me you're a Christian, I don't know where you stand on abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, government aid to those in need (food stamps, welfare, medicaid), socialized medicine (like in Europe), environmentalism, etc.  You may claim those who differ with you on these issues are not real Christians, but they would likely claim the same towards you.  This is known as the "No true Scotsman" (informal) fallacy.

### Q: But I feel the presence of God and you're missing that.

In my youth, I felt what I thought was the presence of God sometimes. A notable one was in a service at our church youth camp.  Some of the girls were crying, but I felt good, perhaps a feeling of love; but I thought it was God, probably the Holy Spirit.  I don't remember the sermon in particular, but it was probably a standard one about how we are sinners and must accept God to be saved.  I now think of this as a feeling of love and community.

A few years ago, I started mediating and that brings out 'spiritual' feelings.  I wouldn't call it spiritual tho, as I don't believe in spirits, but it's a pleasant, relaxed feeling.  Probably similar to what monks feel in prayer.  This is a secular type of Buddhist mediation, Mindfulness Meditation.  A friend recommended the book "Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics" by Dan Harris and Jeff Warren and I tried it and like it.  This is also the type of meditation advocated for and practiced by Sam Harris, the prominent atheist, philosopher, neuroscientist, and author.  The sub-title of the Dan Harris book is "A 10% Happier How-to Book", and I think that's a good way to put it. We're not finding enlightenment, but meditation does seem to help us reduce stress, and maybe be a bit happier.

I also feel a sense of peace and connectedness with the world when I'm out in nature (hiking, jogging, bicycling or motorcycling) and when I'm thinking about some of the deep mysteries of the universe revealed by modern science.

### Q: What to you see as the main harm of religion?

The main harm I see is promoting faith as a virtue.  It leads people to people to believe things based on a feeling, or sense of community, or authority of a church leader, instead of evidence, logic, and reason.  And that, of course, leads to lots of false beliefs and conflict with others of differing beliefs.  And some religions try to impose their particular morals on society in general, when, in some cases, those should be choices for individuals.

Believing untrue things can be very harmful to people.  A Christian friend of mine, a frequent visitor to the Secular Outreach booth here, was a Covid denier and died of what was likely Covid-19 in March of 2021.  He was a good guy, and fun to talk with, but he was a bit out there, as he also believed that the Earth is flat.  But had he been better at separating fact from fiction, he'd likely be alive today.

I also oppose religions imposing their particular ethics via law. Abortion is a complex issue, but many of those who are anti do so out of religious beliefs that souls enter embryos at the point of fertilization, which I do not believe is true.

Religions do some good for societies and individuals, but there are other ways to achieve those good effects.

### Q: Why else don't you believe in God?  [2 of 6]

When I was a kid, my church group went to see the movie "The Ten Commandments" and in that the Exodus story is depicted as written in the Bible.  When Moses lead the Israelites to escape Egypt, he raised his cane and God parted the waters of the Red Sea, with the water was held back, as if with large invisible walls, and solid ground appeared for the people and their carts to rush to the other side on.  Then as the Egyptians in chariots started after them, God let the water go and they drowned.  Then, later, as Moses was away receiving the Ten Commandments, the Israelites reverted to worshiping the Golden Calf.  And thinking about that, it occurred to me that it couldn't have happened that way, as those miracles directed by Moses and his God, were amazing and powerful.  If I had seen that, I'd be a believer for sure, (at least in something unexplained).  So why would I go back to worshiping some ridiculous Golden Calf nonsense that never did anything magical like that?

So it seems to me that that indicates some non-truth or maybe half-truth to the Exodus story.  So it makes more sense that this was a story, a full or partial myth, as it must be at least partially embellished and elaborated upon, over time.  And that makes a lot of sense.  We see examples of this type of thing even today; maybe even more so, with internet-fueled conspiracies, etc.

Other stories in the bible seem like they might have some basis in fact but they make more sense to see them as embellished over time. There may have been a Jesus wandering prophet, and maybe people thought he might have been the messiah, but the miracles are more likely to have been wishful thinking rather than fact.  The stories that got more traction were from those with wilder claims.  See social media today for an analog.

### Q: Why else don't you believe in God?  [3 of 6] [I never get to say all this verbally, as there's no time, but here I    can; for these and 4,5, and 6]

There are various logical inconsistencies in the theology I was brought up in.  Theologians may ponder these and offer what they think of as explanations, but to me these seem more like bending over backwards to reach a conclusion you want.

How can God be all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good, yet allow so much human pain and suffering in the world?  Child cancer, for example, doesn't make any sense.  People sometimes try to explain this via ideas of free-will, but that seems convoluted.  The simplest explanation is that these ideas of God's nature are just incorrect.

How can people be happy in an afterlife if some get into heaven and some, including possibly some loved ones, don't?  Could my mother be happy in heaven if I were in hell?  If she would be, she wouldn't be the same person she was when she was alive; not even close.

The same goes for pets.  How could I be happy in heaven if my dog doesn't make it.  Some people simply believe all dogs go to heaven, but Christian theology is that only people have souls and go to heaven or hell.

Also, how could be be happy for eternity in Heaven?  We're designed (by evolution) to study and learn, work to survive, love to be loved, etc.  We get pleasure in making progress, and suffer in pain.  With all that gone, how could we exist and thrive?

And eternity is a long time.  I could maybe be happy for a few hundred years, but a thousand? million?  billion?  trillions?  And that's just the beginning of eternity.

Also, for those that go to hell.  Isn't that an infinite punishment for a finite sin?  Especially for minor sins.  It doesn't seem like something a just and loving God would do.

I was taught that I needed to believe in Jesus to be saved but how could a just God punish someone for belief?  I have good reasons for what I believe.  It doesn't make sense the God would give us reason and intelligence, but want us to believe in him based on 'faith', i.e., believing without good evidence.  I'm using my "God given" brain as best I can, and it's quite reasonable to conclude that He does not exist.

A second aspect of this is why would God really care that much about a person's belief.  This creator of the Universe, which we now know is billions of galaxies with billions of stars and planets in each, existing for at least 13.7 billion years; why would he care what an individual believes.  Why would he have such a weak ego that he craves adoration like that?  This makes more sense from a evolution of religions perspective [see the "Why else don't you believe in God?  [5 of 6]" section below].

And a third aspect, I also don't think I actually can decide to believe in God (or not), it's really mostly based on a consideration of all the evidence, of what I know and experience.  I could pretend to believe, but I can't really believe it.  I believe things, at least I try to, based on evidence, logic, and reason.  If someone would give me a million dollars to believe a unicorn is running around on the moon, I wouldn't be able to.

I'm also a good person, so it makes no sense that I would go to hell; it seems more likely to me that a young-earth Christian fundamentalist would do so for not using their God-given brains very well.  If the Bible is just taken on faith, how do you know it wasn't inspired by the devil and was put on Earth to test you; so only Atheists would go to heaven.



### Q: Why else don't you believe in God?  [4 of 6]

Think about what it was like hundreds or thousands of years ago when many of the religions formed.  Our ancestors were smart, like we are now, but they didn't have the benefit of modern scientific knowledge. They had no idea were we came from, what the sun is, what causes day/night, the seasons, disease, etc.  Now we do.  It's no wonder they believed in magic.

Some people, even today, believe in all sorts of nonsense.  Some people believe the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, and many others (like me) do not; but whichever is correct, a lot of people believe something that is not true.  Then there's vaccines, and various conspiracy theories.  Even today, with all the scientific, medical, law, and other expertise available at our finger tips, people believe things that are untrue.  And in ancient times, it would be, in many ways, much more difficult to find true ideas.

It's no wonder that people thought about reality, and came up with stories and myths to explain things.  We don't have all the answers today but we know a great deal more than our ancestors did.

In "Pascal's Wager", Pascal "argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas if God does exist, he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses (an eternity in Hell)." [wikipedia].  But my response includes the following: But how do we know which religion God favors? Maybe it's Protestant, or a particular type of that, or Catholic, or Islam, or Hindu, etc.  Or maybe, as above, he really prefers Atheists. As I wrote elsewhere, it doesn't make sense to condemn someone based on their beliefs.  I am living a good life tho, so that might match up with "living as though God exists", but the reasons are not this Wager.



### Q: Why else don't you believe in God?  [5 of 6]

So considering my answers to this and other questions, and thinking about how people function (Psychology and Sociology), it seems very likely that religions evolve.  Much like life itself, religions are in a struggle for survival.  Individual religions don't change much, but they have 'offspring'.  Some die out, some mutate into different forms, and some survive and prosper.  The 'selection criteria' is not whether or not they are true, but how well they appeal to people.  The United States has been, and is, a fertile ecosystem, with many immigrants coming here over the centuries for religious freedom, and no official state religion (so far).

This religious evolution are not a conspiracy, or carefully planned out, but just natural selection.  When someone has a vision that 'clicks' with people, and new branch of a religion can form.  Lots of these go nowhere, but things resonate well enough, often enough, that religions continue.

Look at the LDS church for a good example.  Read up on Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.  Since it was only a short while ago, there are good records.

Another good example is the Adventism and one of the branches of that, the Seventh-day Adventist Church.  "Adventism is a branch of Protestant Christianity[1] that believes in the imminent Second Coming (or the "Second Advent") of Jesus Christ. It originated in the 1830s in the United States during the Second Great Awakening when Baptist preacher William Miller first publicly shared his belief that the Second Coming would occur at some point between 1843 and 1844. His followers became known as Millerites. After Miller's prophecies failed, the Millerite movement split up and was continued by a number of groups that held different doctrines from one another. These groups, stemming from a common Millerite ancestor, became known collectively as the Adventist movement." [Wikipedia]

What's especially interesting to me to note is how the movement didn't die out when Miller's prophecies failed.  Followers of Miller became leaders of new branches, based on their own interpretations and visions.  I suppose some people became disillusioned and withdrew from the Adventism movement, but some continued on and changed.  So there were "mutations" to the religion and some survived the "natural selection" process and survived.

There's a good list Unfulfilled Christian Religious Predictions at: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfulfilled_Christian_religious_predictions)

Of course, the big attraction of religion is the life after death idea. And, of course, we don't want to die; survival is a fundamental aspect to our existence, part of our deep seated drives to live and survive, put there by evolution.  But we know we are going to die.  So that angst is something that religions can tap into (again, not consciously designed but sometimes it is happened upon, and it works to motivate people).

Another 'feature' 'selected for' is the idea that one should convert others to the religion.  Christian Fundamentalists, for example, think it is important to try to convert others, and clearly that has survival value for the religion.

And, of course, most religions stress the need to raise children in the religion to continue it.

There are other psychological and social functions that religion serves and drives their appeal but, again, it has nothing to do with Truth.

### Q: Why else don't you believe in God?  [6 of 6]

The idea of a soul doesn't make sense.  If my soul is the real me, it must be the source of my thinking, feelings, and memories.  But we now know that that is what our brains do.  So if my soul exists it's like it is sort of along for the ride, and will continue doing brain functions after my brain decomposes, which doesn't make sense.

And my soul can't just continue where my brain left off when I die because if I get changed by age-related dementia or strokes or other brain injuries, it doesn't make sense that I would spend eternity not really myself, e.g. with little or no understanding of what's going on or even who I am (or was).  So then we need to expect that my soul will get revitalized after I die, to sometime when I was healthy, I guess.  Maybe when I was 21 or so.  Or is in my 60s good enough?  So then is my soul running slower as my brain slows down with age?

And of course, the idea that a fertilized human egg has a soul doesn't make sense.  It's just a single cell, no thoughts or feelings.  After a lot of cell division, differentiation, and brain nerve cell connection, there's eventually a basic brain, but that's later.

Similarly, the Hindu idea of reincarnation never made sense to me.  If my soul had previously been in a frog, or something, it would not be me in any real sense, because I'm a lot more aware and smarter than a frog (I don't want to brag, but I believe that's true :-) ).

I do believe that I'm more than just my thoughts, feelings, and memories, but certainly those are major components of who I am.

### Q: You quote Wikipedia often but how can it be reliable when anyone can edit it (volunteer editors)?

It is often difficult to decide what is a reliable source of information, especially on the internet, but it is important to do so.

There's a good (but very detailed) description of the Reliability of Wikipedia on their own page. [Wikipedia Reliability_of_Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_of_Wikipedia)

They discuss a study I like to mention too, the December 2005 study in the journal Nature which concluded that "Wikipedia comes close to Britannica in terms of the accuracy of its science entries".  The wikipedia page goes on to discuss arguments over that conclusion, but I think that this and other studies provide good evidence that Wikipedia is quite reliable, overall.

Sometimes articles get messed up, but the team of volunteer editors who generate online content, and check each others' work, do an excellent job, in my opinion, of correcting mistakes quickly and maintaining overall accuracy.

Like any source, it's good to check others too, and Wikipedia includes many references in the articles too that can also be checked.

Here again is where 'critical thinking' is important.  We should try to avoid our own biases, etc, and check multiple sources, and follow the evidence where it leads.  "Critical thinking is the analysis of available facts, evidence, observations, and arguments in order to form a judgement by the application of rational, skeptical, and unbiased analyses and evaluation."

### Q: What about all the prophesies that Jesus fulfilled?

As I've discussed in some of my other answers, it seems very likely to me that many of the stories in the bible are at least partially myth and/or elaborated upon before being written down, so it's not surprising that the more recent stories (New Testament) conform to the prophesies of the older ones (Old Testament).  The stories that didn't, died out.

There are also cases where Jesus, if Jesus existed*, was said to be doing things to fulfill prophesies, for example when riding a donkey into Jerusalem, as described in the first part of Matthew 21. According to some Christians, "Matthew’s gospel was geared towards a Jewish audience and takes special care to prove that Jesus was the Messiah. In keeping with his gospel’s overall focus, Matthew purposefully mentioned the donkey and the colt to show that Jesus fulfilled a messianic prophecy in Zechariah: [...]". [biblestudytools.com](https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/topical-studies/why-did-jesus-ride-donkey-triumphant-entry.html) why-did-jesus-ride-donkey-triumphant-entry.

* In my view, Jesus was either mythical and historicised, or historical and mythicised (there is evidence for each view).  There may have been a wandering prophet named Jesus, around which some myths grew.

### Q: But I believe your non-belief is condeming you to Hell, don't you think it's safer to believe?

This is "Pascal's Wager", and I've discussed it some, but I'll address it more here.

I recently talked with Hindus (on my Eclipse trip, owners of a motel), some Jewish people (guys who stopped by at the booth briefly), and a Native American (new booth person), and it's interesting that in all of these religions, actions are more important than beliefs.  That's why many Jews are OK with Atheists.  And for Hindus, it's good actions that bring good karma and a higher position in the next life. Similarly for Native American beliefs, there's a spiritual world, but living in harmony with the natural world and environment is important and particular beliefs are not.

For some forms of Christianity, more progressive Protestant denominations, doing good seems to be stressed too, more so than beliefs.  The most important commandment is to love one another and as per the Good Samaritan, this includes people of other tribes.  And what is good could vary from the conservative Christians' views.

Those other religions may not expect others to go to hell if they don't believe the 'right' stuff, but if God exists, and does punish people for not believing or doing the right things, I think it is much more likely that actions are much more important than beliefs and I expect that God would be more aligned with progressive/modern ideas of goodness.

So, in regards to Pascal's Wager, I believe it's very unlikely that: 1) there is life after death, or that 2) God exists, or that 3) if God exists He would punish anyone for a long time, especially eternity, or that 4) if He would be judging people it would be on beliefs (i.e. picking the right religion) instead of actions (or something else).

None of us are perfect, but I do think I've done (and am doing) more good in my life than bad, and so I think I'd be OK, even in the very unlikely case that I'm wrong on three of the four points above.  On on the fourth point, I think I'm playing it with the odds in my favor; I hope you are too.

I don't do good to try to get into a mythical heaven, but because I'm a mentally healthy person, with a fair amount of empathy, who grew up in a positive home environment and culture.  I'm a Secular Humanist.
