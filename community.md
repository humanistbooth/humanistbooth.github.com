**Local Secular Communities**

One of the things that we do at the Humanist [Outreach Booth](https://www.facebook.com/askanatheistbooth/)  (at Balboa Park in San Diego most Saturdays) is tell people about some of the local non-religious/Humanist/Atheist groups and meetings that people can attend.  Religions provide community for many, but there are some non-religious alternatives available too and they can be a lot of fun and worthwhile.

***Our booth***

One is our booth itself.  If you enjoy this kind of outreach, and can follow a few simple rules, you're welcome to join us for a few minutes, hours, or all day Saturdays (except on rainy days or special events) in Balboa Park.  We enjoy talking with each other (fun to be with like-minded people) and chatting with vistors, both supporters and religious.  Some discussions with religious folks can be quite interesting and worthwhile.  We don't try to convert, but to make people think.  And we try to be an example to people that there are many of us Agnostic Atheists, and we're good people too. It's also nice to people-watch and enjoy the park.  And it's refreshing to be in a situation where we get to discuss religion, philosophy, science, history, critical thinking, morals, meaning, reality, psychology, sociology, etc, with friends and strangers (many from other countries).

***Sunday Assembly San Diego***

Another is [Sunday Assembly San Diego](https://www.sundayassemblysandiego.org/) which is an inclusive non-religious community that meets monthly.  They (/we) also have some other events throughout the month including community service projects and a variety of social activities.  Their (/our) moto is: Live Better. Help Often. Wonder More.  Some of the booth regular attendees are also part of Sunday Assembly (talk with Wayne or Diane for more).

***Unitarian Universalist congregations***

Another are the Unitarian Universalist congregations around the county, including First UU church near downtown.  They are religious, but creedless and progressive, and open to non-religious people, as well as those of different faiths.  In some congregations about a third of the people are Agnostic Atheists.  For some of us, this was a good place to attend with our children, so they could learn about religions without being indoctrinated.  UUs don't argue with each other, but are accepting of all as long as they share their life-affirming (i.e. Humanist) foundational beliefs.  They meet weekly and have many activities, programs, summer camps, etc.

***Areteanism***

There's also [Areteanism] (https://bio.site/areteanism) which is "a humanist religion that values science over faith, and individual interpretation over dogma.".  Rob, the guy that makes our booth happen, attended this once and it seemed to him be a worthwhile Humanist group.

***Secular Student Alliance***

For students, there is also the the [Secular Student Alliance](https://secularstudents.org/) which "empowers secular students to proudly express their identity, build welcoming communities, promote secular values, and set a course for lifelong activism".  There is a [UCSD chapter](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SecularStudentsUCSD/) and an [SDSU chapter](https://www.facebook.com/groups/secularstudentalliance.sdsu/).
